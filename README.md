# Signal K Resources Provider Plugin:

This plugin is a resource provider, facilitating the storage and retrieval of the following resource types defined by the Signal K specification:
- `resources/routes`

as well as providing the capability to serve custom resource types provisioned as additional paths under `/signalk/v2/api/resources`.

- _example:_ `/signalk/v2/api/resources/fishingZones`   

Each path is provisioned with `GET`, `PUT`, `POST` and `DELETE` operations enabled.
